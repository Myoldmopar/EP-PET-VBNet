EnergyPlus Parameter Estimation Tool

This tool is used to regress manufacturer or experimental data into the form required to be used in EnergyPlus input files. 

The tool's main features include:
* The ability to paste in data -almost- directly from manufacturer's data sheets, though some pasting will need to be massaged first.
* The creation of EnergyPlus input objects or parameter summaries based on this data.
* Graphical reporting on the quality of the input data as well as the resulting component parameters.
* Easy extensibility, with special numbered hooks in the code for performing extension to additional units or component types.

This tool is superseded by a python version, available here: github.com/myoldmopar/energypluspet
